## L-System Tree Generation Applications - Python and Haskell

L-System Tree Generation Applications built using **Python**, and **Haskell**.

### Features



### Installation

Simply clone the repository to your machine.

```
git clone https://github.com/Tong-JT/fractal-tree-python-haskell.git
```
To run the Python application, install Tkinter globally or within virtual environment

```
pip install tk
```

The Haskell program was built with dependencies, including **Gloss**, **OpenGL**, and **GLUT**. These dependencies are stored within the `TreeHaskell.cabal` file, so it should run out of the box.
To rebuild dependencies, run the following commands in the terminal:

1. `cabal clean`
2. `cabal update`
3. `cabal build`

To run the program, use the command `cabal run` in the terminal.
